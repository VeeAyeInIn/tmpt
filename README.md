# TMPT

First, thank you so much to the people in the Pixelmon Discord, they helped me through a bunch of issues I had. I am more used to the Fabric API, so having people able to help me with Forge 1.12.2 was very great.

This mod is rather simple, it adds a bunch of advancements that do not exist in Pixelmon, specifically as of now, only catching some. I tried my best to make them mesh well with the pre-existing advancements, but my naming sense is poor, to be honest. 

v1.0.0
- Added LegendaryCaptureTrigger to each remaining legendary and mythical Pixelmon.
- Created UltraBeastCaptureTrigger, which functions similarly to LegendaryCaptureTrigger, but is in a separate advancement tab specifically for Ultra Beasts.
